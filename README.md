This course takes a deep dive into technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. We're unleashing our creativity and building a minimalistic website, while learning and following modern web development trends.

### THE 7 PROJECTS
- Interactive animated sticky header: Using plain and pure CSS3 and jQuery, you're going to learn how to build a sticky, animated header that you'll be able to use in ANY of your upcoming websites.
- Parallax cover page that tracks mouse movements: In this section, we're starting with the website creation process and the first section that we'll be building is a Parallax Cover Page that will track your mouse movements and animate accordingly!
- Responsive grid layout gallery: Using Masonry.Js, you'll be building the second part of our website which is a fully responsive grid system, used to showcase portfolio work or photography collages!
- Beating heart animation: Using pure CSS3 and keyframes, I'll show you how to achieve an amazing beating heart animation done in less than 10 minutes!
- Responsive slider with navigation: Using Slick Slider, we're going to be building a fully navigable, responsive slider. We'll also explore the customization limits of the library and how you can create your perfect slider.
